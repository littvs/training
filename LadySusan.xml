            <opener>Lady Susan Vernon to Mr. Vernon. Langford, Dec.</opener>
            <p>MY DEAR BROTHER,—I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of profiting by your kind
               invitation when we last parted of spending some weeks with you at Churchhill, and,
               therefore, if quite convenient to you and Mrs. Vernon to receive me at present, I
               shall hope within a few days to be introduced to a sister whom I have so long desired
               to be acquainted with. My kind friends here are most affectionately urgent with me to
               prolong my stay, but their hospitable and cheerful dispositions lead them too much
               into society for my present situation and state of mind; and I impatiently look
               forward to the hour when I shall be admitted into your delightful retirement.</p> 
            <p>I long
               to be made known to your dear little children, in whose hearts I shall be very eager
               to secure an interest. I shall soon have need for all my fortitude, as I am on the
               point of separation from my own daughter. The long illness of her dear father
               prevented my paying her that attention which duty and affection equally dictated, and
               I have too much reason to fear that the governess to whose care I consigned her was
               unequal to the charge. I have therefore resolved on placing her at one of the best
               private schools in town, where I shall have an opportunity of leaving her myself in
               my way to you. I am determined, you see, not to be denied admittance at Churchhill.
               It would indeed give me most painful sensations to know that it were not in your
               power to receive me.</p>
            <closer>Your most obliged and affectionate sister, S. VERNON.</closer>

            <opener> Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson. Langford.</opener>
            <p>You were mistaken, my dear Alicia, in supposing me fixed at this place for the rest
               of the winter: it grieves me to say how greatly you were mistaken, for I have seldom
               spent three months more agreeably than those which have just flown away. At present,
               nothing goes smoothly; the females of the family are united against me. You foretold
               how it would be when I first came to Langford, and Mainwaring is so uncommonly
               pleasing that I was not without apprehensions for myself. I remember saying to
               myself, as I drove to the house, “I like this man, pray Heaven no harm come of it!”
               But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only four months a
               widow, and to be as quiet as possible: and I have been so, my dear creature; I have
               admitted no one’s attentions but Mainwaring’s. I have avoided all general flirtation
               whatever; I have distinguished no creature besides, of all the numbers resorting
               hither, except Sir James Martin, on whom I bestowed a little notice, in order to
               detach him from Miss Mainwaring; but, if the world could know my motive there they
               would honour me. I have been called an unkind mother, but it was the sacred impulse
               of maternal affection, it was the advantage of my daughter that led me on; and if
               that daughter were not the greatest simpleton on earth, I might have been rewarded
               for my exertions as I ought.</p> <p>Sir James did make proposals to me for Frederica; but
               Frederica, who was born to be the torment of my life, chose to set herself so
               violently against the match that I thought it better to lay aside the scheme for the
               present. I have more than once repented that I did not marry him myself; and were he
               but one degree less contemptibly weak I certainly should: but I must own myself
               rather romantic in that respect, and that riches only will not satisfy me. The event
               of all this is very provoking: Sir James is gone, Maria highly incensed, and Mrs.
               Mainwaring insupportably jealous; so jealous, in short, and so enraged against me,
               that, in the fury of her temper, I should not be surprized at her appealing to her
               guardian, if she had the liberty of addressing him: but there your husband stands my
               friend; and the kindest, most amiable action of his life was his throwing her off for
               ever on her marriage. Keep up his resentment, therefore, I charge you. We are now in
               a sad state; no house was ever more altered; the whole party are at war, and
               Mainwaring scarcely dares speak to me. It is time for me to be gone; I have therefore
               determined on leaving them, and shall spend, I hope, a comfortable day with you in
               town within this week. If I am as little in favour with Mr. Johnson as ever, you must
               come to me at 10 Wigmore street; but I hope this may not be the case, for as Mr.
               Johnson, with all his faults, is a man to whom that great word “respectable” is
               always given, and I am known to be so intimate with his wife, his slighting me has an
               awkward look.</p> <p>I take London in my way to that insupportable spot, a country village;
               for I am really going to Churchhill. Forgive me, my dear friend, it is my last
               resource. Were there another place in England open to me I would prefer it. Charles
               Vernon is my aversion; and I am afraid of his wife. At Churchhill, however, I must
               remain till I have something better in view. My young lady accompanies me to town,
               where I shall deposit her under the care of Miss Summers, in Wigmore street, till she
               becomes a little more reasonable. She will made good connections there, as the girls
               are all of the best families. The price is immense, and much beyond what I can ever
               attempt to pay.</p> 
            <p>Adieu, I will send you a line as soon as I arrive in town.</p>
            <closer> Yours ever, S. VERNON.</closer>

            <head>III</head> <opener>Mrs. Vernon to Lady De Courcy. Churchhill.</opener>
            <p>My dear Mother,—I am very sorry to tell you that it will not be in our power to keep
               our promise of spending our Christmas with you; and we are prevented that happiness
               by a circumstance which is not likely to make us any amends. Lady Susan, in a letter
               to her brother-in-law, has declared her intention of visiting us almost immediately;
               and as such a visit is in all probability merely an affair of convenience, it is
               impossible to conjecture its length. I was by no means prepared for such an event,
               nor can I now account for her ladyship’s conduct; Langford appeared so exactly the
               place for her in every respect, as well from the elegant and expensive style of
               living there, as from her particular attachment to Mr. Mainwaring, that I was very
               far from expecting so speedy a distinction, though I always imagined from her
               increasing friendship for us since her husband’s death that we should, at some future
               period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great deal too kind to
               her when he was in Staffordshire; her behaviour to him, independent of her general
               character, has been so inexcusably artful and ungenerous since our marriage was first
               in agitation that no one less amiable and mild than himself could have overlooked it
               all; and though, as his brother’s widow, and in narrow circumstances, it was proper
               to render her pecuniary assistance, I cannot help thinking his pressing invitation to
               her to visit us at Churchhill perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however, as he always
               is to think the best of everyone, her display of grief, and professions of regret,
               and general resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to soften his heart and make him
               really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself, I am still unconvinced, and
               plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot make up my mind till I better
               understand her real meaning in coming to us. You may guess, therefore, my dear madam,
               with what feelings I look forward to her arrival. She will have occasion for all
               those attractive powers for which she is celebrated to gain any share of my regard;
               and I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself against their influence, if not
               accompanied by something more substantial. She expresses a most eager desire of being
               acquainted with me, and makes very gracious mention of my children but I am not quite
               weak enough to suppose a woman who has behaved with inattention, if not with
               unkindness, to her own child, should be attached to any of mine. Miss Vernon is to be
               placed at a school in London before her mother comes to us which I am glad of, for
               her sake and my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from her mother, and
               a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an education, could not be a very
               desirable companion here. Reginald has long wished, I know, to see the captivating
               Lady Susan, and we shall depend on his joining our party soon. I am glad to hear that
               my father continues so well; and am, with best love, &amp;c., </p>

            <opener>Mr. De Courcy to Mrs. Vernon. Parklands.</opener>
            <p>My dear Sister,—I congratulate you and Mr. Vernon on being about to receive into your
               family the most accomplished coquette in England. As a very distinguished flirt I
               have always been taught to consider her, but it has lately fallen in my way to hear
               some particulars of her conduct at Langford: which prove that she does not confine
               herself to that sort of honest flirtation which satisfies most people, but aspires to
               the more delicious gratification of making a whole family miserable. By her behaviour
               to Mr. Mainwaring she gave jealousy and wretchedness to his wife, and by her
               attentions to a young man previously attached to Mr. Mainwaring’s sister deprived an
               amiable girl of her lover.</p> <p>I learnt all this from Mr. Smith, now in this
               neighbourhood (I have dined with him, at Hurst and Wilford), who is just come from
               Langford where he was a fortnight with her ladyship, and who is therefore well
               qualified to make the communication.</p> <p>What a woman she must be! I long to see her, and
               shall certainly accept your kind invitation, that I may form some idea of those
               bewitching powers which can do so much—engaging at the same time, and in the same
               house, the affections of two men, who were neither of them at liberty to bestow
               them—and all this without the charm of youth! I am glad to find Miss Vernon does not
               accompany her mother to Churchhill, as she has not even manners to recommend her;
               and, according to Mr. Smith’s account, is equally dull and proud. Where pride and
               stupidity unite there can be no dissimulation worthy notice, and Miss Vernon shall be
               consigned to unrelenting contempt; but by all that I can gather Lady Susan possesses
               a degree of captivating deceit which it must be pleasing to witness and detect. I
               shall be with you very soon, and am ever, </p>
            <closer>Your affectionate brother, R. DE COURCY.</closer>

            <opener>Lady Susan Vernon to Mrs. Johnson. Churchhill.</opener>
            <p>I received your note, my dear Alicia, just before I left town, and rejoice to be
               assured that Mr. Johnson suspected nothing of your engagement the evening before. It
               is undoubtedly better to deceive him entirely, and since he will be stubborn he must
               be tricked. I arrived here in safety, and have no reason to complain of my reception
               from Mr. Vernon; but I confess myself not equally satisfied with the behaviour of his
               lady. She is perfectly well-bred, indeed, and has the air of a woman of fashion, but
               her manners are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in my favour. I
               wanted her to be delighted at seeing me. I was as amiable as possible on the
               occasion, but all in vain. She does not like me. To be sure, when we consider that I
               did take some pains to prevent my brother-in-law’s marrying her, this want of
               cordiality is not very surprizing, and yet it shows an illiberal and vindictive
               spirit to resent a project which influenced me six years ago, and which never
               succeeded at last.</p> <p>I am sometimes disposed to repent that I did not let Charles buy
               Vernon Castle, when we were obliged to sell it; but it was a trying circumstance,
               especially as the sale took place exactly at the time of his marriage; and everybody
               ought to respect the delicacy of those feelings which could not endure that my
               husband’s dignity should be lessened by his younger brother’s having possession of
               the family estate. Could matters have been so arranged as to prevent the necessity of
               our leaving the castle, could we have lived with Charles and kept him single, I
               should have been very far from persuading my husband to dispose of it elsewhere; but
               Charles was on the point of marrying Miss De Courcy, and the event has justified me.
               Here are children in abundance, and what benefit could have accrued to me from his
               purchasing Vernon? My having prevented it may perhaps have given his wife an
               unfavourable impression, but where there is a disposition to dislike, a motive will
               never be wanting; and as to money matters it has not withheld him from being very
               useful to me. I really have a regard for him, he is so easily imposed upon! The house
               is a good one, the furniture fashionable, and everything announces plenty and
               elegance. Charles is very rich I am sure; when a man has once got his name in a
               banking-house he rolls in money; but they do not know what to do with it, keep very
               little company, and never go to London but on business. We shall be as stupid as
               possible. I mean to win my sister-in-law’s heart through the children; I know all
               their names already, and am going to attach myself with the greatest sensibility to
               one in particular, a young Frederic, whom I take on my lap and sigh over for his dear
               uncle’s sake.</p> <p>Poor Mainwaring! I need not tell you how much I miss him, how
               perpetually he is in my thoughts. I found a dismal letter from him on my arrival
               here, full of complaints of his wife and sister, and lamentations on the cruelty of
               his fate. I passed off the letter as his wife’s, to the Vernons, and when I write to
               him it must be under cover to you.</p>
            <closer>Ever yours, S. VERNON.</closer>
